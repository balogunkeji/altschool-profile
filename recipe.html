        <h2>Tips & Notes</h2>
        <p><strong>Beating the butter and sugar is the most important part</strong> of the chocolate chip cookie-making process. It takes a lot longer than you might think - beat the ingredients together for about <em>four minutes</em>. <mark>Chill the dough before baking</mark> to prevent spreading and ensure cookies that are still a little gooey in the middle. Make sure to let the cookies rest on the baking sheet for a few minutes after removing from the oven to prevent tearing.</p>
